### TODO : implement the BigUint type for the RSA keypair generation

## Please, install the following VSCode extensions:
- [Rust](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1YiB.rust-bundle). It's a bundle with some useful extensions for Rust development

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare). It's a tool to share your code with other developers in real-time. We'll use it for live coding sessions.

- [LaTex Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop). It's a tool that we use for writing the project documentation. It has some great features such as the live preview in a VSCode tab, and graphic buttons to compile the document. (*I think you'll have to install a LaTex distribution on your computer to use this extension. Just follow the instructions on the extension page*)

## IMPORTANT: 
Before writing any code, **change your Word Wrapp setting to "wordWrapColumn": 80** in your VSCode settings. This is essential, as it's said on our CdC that we have to give a project that respects the 80 characters per line rule. If you have any questions about this procedure ask on the group's Discord server.
